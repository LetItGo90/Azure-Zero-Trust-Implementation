# Zero Trust Architecture Implementation in Azure

## Project Objectives

This project aims to implement a comprehensive Zero Trust security model in Azure that:

1. Demonstrates practical implementation of Zero Trust principles in a cloud environment
2. Provides a reference architecture that can be adapted to enterprise environments
3. Showcases Azure security controls that support a Zero Trust approach
4. Creates a documented, repeatable deployment process using infrastructure as code

## Zero Trust Principles Implemented

This implementation follows core Zero Trust principles:

1. **Verify explicitly**: All access requests are authenticated and authorized based on all available data points
   - Conditional Access policies with MFA
   - Risk-based authentication
   - Device compliance requirements

2. **Use least privilege access**: Just-in-time and just-enough-access (JIT/JEA)
   - Just-in-Time VM access
   - Privileged access management
   - Network segmentation with NSGs

3. **Assume breach**: Minimize blast radius and segment access
   - Network segmentation
   - Lateral movement prevention
   - Real-time monitoring and alerting

## Resources to be Deployed

The following Azure resources will be deployed:

1. **Networking**
   - Virtual Network with multiple subnets (frontend, backend)
   - Network Security Groups with strict access rules
   - Private endpoints for PaaS services

2. **Compute**
   - Virtual Machines with JIT access enabled
   - Azure Bastion for secure management

3. **Security Services**
   - Microsoft Defender for Cloud (Standard tier)
   - Key Vault for secret management
   - Azure AD Conditional Access

4. **Monitoring**
   - Log Analytics workspace
   - Security alerts and monitoring

## Security Controls Implemented

This architecture implements the following security controls:

1. **Identity and Access Management**
   - Multi-factor authentication for all users
   - Conditional Access policies based on user, device, location, and risk
   - Just-in-time VM access

2. **Network Security**
   - Network segmentation via subnets and NSGs
   - Deny-by-default rules with explicit allow lists
   - Micro-segmentation between application tiers

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Key management through Azure Key Vault
   - Access control to data resources

4. **Security Monitoring and Response**
   - Centralized logging and monitoring
   - Automated remediation for common issues
   - Security alerts and notifications

5. **Compliance Controls**
   - Alignment with NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture
   - Continuous compliance monitoring
   - Regular security assessments
